# Fake Reviews Detection using NLP 📝🤖  

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify **fake vs genuine product reviews**.  
It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, machine learning model training, evaluation, and insights.

---

## 📘 File Included

- **Fake-Reviews-Detection-NLP.ipynb**
  - Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopwords removal)
  - Feature engineering (TF-IDF / BOW / Embeddings)
  - ML model implementation (Logistic Regression / SVM / Naive Bayes)
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
  - Visualizations and insights

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Common libraries used in NLP projects:

```
numpy  
pandas  
matplotlib  
sklearn  
nltk  
regex  
```

If your notebook uses more (e.g., spaCy, transformers), we can update this later.
